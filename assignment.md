# Frontend React Native coding assessment

## Dear Candidate

Welcome to our take-home coding assessment. We trust you'll find this assessment both challenging and rewarding, and we look forward to the opportunity to discuss your accomplishments further in the next stage.

## Your Challenge

Develop a cross-platform mobile application using React Native and TypeScript that allows users to search for movies in an open API movie database. The app should display 10 random movies on the home screen along with a search bar. Users should be able to search for movies and view detailed information about each movie, including title, description, poster, actors, and reviews. As a bonus, create a network business logic SDK that can be reused in a React.js project and integrate a state manager solution.

## Project features

- Integration with Open API Movie Database: Utilize the provided open API movie database (https://search.imdbot.workers.dev/) to fetch movie data. As an alternative you can use any Movie DB API like (https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started)

#### Home Screen:

- Display 10 random movies on the home screen.
  = Include a search bar at the top of the screen for users to search for movies.

#### Search Functionality:

- Implement search functionality that allows users to search for movies based on title or keywords.
  = Display search results in a list with movie posters and titles.

#### Movie Detail Screen:

- Create a movie detail screen that shows detailed information about a selected movie.
- Display the movie's title, description, poster, actors, list of reviews, and keywords.

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility:

- Ensure that the app runs smoothly on both iOS and Android devices.

#### Business Logic Separation Development:

- Develop a network business logic SDK in TypeScript that encapsulates the logic for fetching movie data from the API.
- The SDK should be designed to be reusable and integrate seamlessly with a state manager solution.
- Include functions for fetching random movies, searching for movies, and retrieving movie details.

#### State Manager Solution:

- Integrate a state manager solution such as Redux or MobX to manage the application's state.
- Use the state manager to manage global state, including movie data, search results, and selected movie details.

## Bonus Features:

- SDK Usage in React Native Project
- Demonstrate the usage of the developed SDK in a React Native project.
- Integrate the SDK into a basic React Native application to fetch and display movie data.
- Implement optimizations in the state manager solution to improve performance and efficiency.

## Additional Guidelines:

- Use React Native with TypeScript for building the mobile application.
- Utilize React Navigation for navigation between screens.
- Implement reusable components where applicable to improve code maintainability.
- Follow best practices for UI/UX design to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface.
- The design is up to you
- Handle loading states and error messages gracefully.
- Write clean and well-structured code with comments where necessary.
- Test the app thoroughly on both iOS and Android devices to ensure compatibility and functionality.

## How to submit your work

- Start by creating a new Git repository on a platform like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket (all the code is your IP)
- Create README.md for the project with the setup instruction
- The application must be able to run based on the README instructions
- Share the public git repository URL

## Recommendations

- Read the features and the bonus features carefully before you start coding
- Committing changes at appropriate intervals in Git
- Leave TODO in the code if you couldn't finish a solution, you have chance to explain it during the interview

## Interview process

- You have 4 days to complete the assessment. We know everyone is busy, so if you need one more day let us know.
- During the interview you need to explain and demonstrate the code via the feature requirements
